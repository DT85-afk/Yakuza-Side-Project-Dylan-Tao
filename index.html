        <h2 class="header-2">Yakuza is a fun game with fun combat
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The combat in the game, although it appears to be a simple button masher, there is more depth for players that are looking for it. The best thing about that depth is that unlike some games it isn't too hard to perform and execute. It's just a lot of knowing and knowledge with the game's systems.

        <p class="paragraph">
            For example here is a list of the varied fighting styles in one of the games Yakuza 0. Here you can switch between them in order to suit various situations similar to a game such as Ghost of Tsushima
